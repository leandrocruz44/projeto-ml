                <h1>Aladdin Sane - David Bowie</h1>
                <p><strong>Aladdin Sane</strong> is the sixth studio album by English musician <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" target="_blank" rel="external">David Bowie</a></strong>, released on 13 April 1973 through RCA Records. The follow-up to his breakthrough The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), it was the first album he wrote and released from a position of stardom. It was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features contributions from Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars — comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey — as well as pianist Mike Garson, two saxophonists and three backing vocalists. Recorded at Trident Studios in London and RCA Studios in New York City between legs of the Ziggy Stardust Tour, the record was Bowie's final album with the full Spiders lineup.</p>
